## Supported Versions

There is only one version track for CISDSC so all patches will be applied to the latest version only.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Bug or Vulnerability

Critical vulnerabilities can be responsibly disclosed to [securitysupport@illinois.edu](mailto:securitysupport@illinois.edu). Bugs and low level vulneratbilities can be reported via repository issues.

## Support Lifecycle
- Resources will be updated whenever CIS publishes a new draft of a given resource.
- Bugs will be addressed on resources as long as their associated product is still in support from the vendor.
- At this time there is no plans to age old resources out of the module.
